### hugorithm 

Just a guy who likes to press keys for a living.   
I also love to build cool and performant projects, and ultimately develop really awesome software.

Fun Facts
* I'm a fan of good beer so I've made a [beer selling platform!](https://www.github.com/hugorithm/HopfenCraft) 
* I've conducted my Master Thesis in Blockchain technology, more specifically Hyperledger Fabric. 
* Besides programming, I really love music so I teached myself how to play electic guitar.
* I also play piano on my spare time. I guess pressing keys really runs in my blood ðŸ˜†.
* I'm learning Rust ðŸ¦€.
